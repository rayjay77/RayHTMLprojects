        <center>The Principles of Design</center>
    </h1>
    <p>Have you ever wondered what goes into the creation of a successful design piece? Here are some visual tools that can help you structure your design compositions.
    </p>
    <p>In this article, we'll talk about the principles of design and their importance. This set of visual tools can help you create an organized structure to deliver a clear message. These principles are also applied in art and different design sub-disciplines.
        Along with definitions, we'll show you a few examples of the principles of design that will help you better understand their meaning.</p>
    <h1>
        <center>What Are the Principles of Design?</center>
    </h1>
    <p><strong>The principles of design are a set of rules that designers can follow 
when creating a composition to create visually pleasing work.</strong> The purpose of these rules is to deliver a message in the most organized and functional way.</p>
    <p>While we've all seen our fair share of experimental pieces out there, it's important to know the significance of the fundamentals. Every design piece has a structure below the surface that holds up the design and makes it visually interesting and
        balanced. Once designers understand the usage of the principles, they'll understand better how to break these rules.</p>
    <p>In my previous article, <strong>The Basic Elements of Design</strong>, I talked about the elements that create everything we perceive. With a solid understanding of those elements, you'll be able to learn more about the principles of design</p>

        <center>Principles of Design: Balance</center>
    </h1>
    <p>Any element placed on a page carries a visual weight. It can range from form to size, color, and texture. <strong>In order to make a design feel stable or have 
balance, the elements need to have a certain scale.</strong></p>
    <p>For instance, in a symmetrical design, the elements on the right side have the same visual weight as the elements on the left side. Symmetrical designs are easier to balance but can also come across as boring. Asymmetrical designs have different sides
        but equal visual weight. Being able to achieve balance in asymmetry can result in a visually interesting design that has movement.</p>
    <p>Lack of balance would make your design feel heavy on one side and empty on the opposite. If you're wondering about principles of design balance examples, you'll know your design lacks balance when it feels as if it's falling off to one side.</p>
